Use the theme of coffee for creating nicknames. Defined as drinks you can buy at a coffee shop.

Avoid using full Pokemon names and the theme name. Ensure a strong link between the Pokemon's attributes and the theme. Each nickname should combine an aspect of each.

Example:
For an electric-type Pokemon:

pokemon: Jolteon
nicknames: EspressoSpark, ZapuccinoBolt, VoltMocha
