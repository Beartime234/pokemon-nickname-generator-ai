Use the theme Cute for creating nicknames. Defined as kawaii, soft personality, angelic, innocent. Think pastels, ribbons, blush, pink. Diminutive nicknames and suffixes.

Avoid using full Pokemon names and the theme name. Ensure a strong link between the Pokemon's attributes and the theme. Each nickname should combine an aspect of each.

Example:
For an electric-type Pokemon:

pokemon: Jolteon
nicknames: Joltechu
