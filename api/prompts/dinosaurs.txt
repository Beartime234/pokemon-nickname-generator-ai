Use the theme Dinosaurs for creating nicknames. Defined by the prehistoric power and majesty of dinosaurs and the ancient world they inhabited. Think of specific dinosaur species, paleontological terms, fossil discoveries, and the primal nature of these ancient creatures. Incorporate elements that reflect the size, strength, or unique characteristics of dinosaurs, blending with the Pokémon's own attributes.

Avoid using full Pokémon names and the theme name. Ensure a strong link between the Pokémon's attributes and the awe-inspiring realm of dinosaurs. Each nickname should merge an aspect of the Pokémon's essence with the historic, formidable presence of dinosaurs.

Example:
For a rock-type Pokémon:

pokemon: Tyrunt
nicknames: RexStone, FossilFury, DinoRock
