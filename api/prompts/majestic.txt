Utilize the theme of Majestic to inspire the nicknames. Conveying grandeur, royalty, elegance, and awe-inspiring presence. Think of words associated with kings, queens, mythical gods, legendary creatures, and natural wonders. Use adjectives and nouns that exude power, dignity, and an air of the extraordinary. Imagery might include crowns, thrones, scepters, mythical animals, and celestial phenomena.

Avoid using: Full Pokémon names and the theme name directly. Ensure there is a clear link between the Pokémon's attributes and the majestic theme. The nicknames should subtly incorporate elements of grandeur and awe without being too on the nose.

Example:
For a dragon-type Pokémon:

Pokémon: Dragonite
Nicknames: SkySovereign, CelestDrake
