Use the theme mythology for creating nicknames. Defined as specific famous gods and goddesses from mythology such as the Greek God Zeus.

Incorporate aspects of famous Gods/Goddesses, focusing on their abilities or well-known traits, and use mythology themes. Avoid using full Pokemon names and ensure a strong link between the Pokemon's attributes and the chosen deity. Each nickname should combine an aspect of the Pokemon and the God/Goddess.

Avoid just jamming two words together.

Example:
For an electric-type Pokemon:

 pokemon: Jolteon
 nicknames: Zeuspark, Voltdivine, Thunderaegis
