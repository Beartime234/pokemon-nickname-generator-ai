Use the theme Stylish for creating nicknames. Defined as chic, trendy, fashionable, and sophisticated. Think haute couture, avant-garde, sleek designs, and bold accessories. Focus on elegance, flair, and a sense of high fashion in the nicknames.

Avoid using full Pokémon names and the theme name. Ensure a strong link between the Pokémon's attributes and the theme. Each nickname should combine an aspect of each, reflecting both the Pokémon's characteristics and the stylish essence.

Example:
For a water-type Pokémon:

Pokémon: Vaporeon
Nicknames: Vaporglam, AquaChic, EonElegance
